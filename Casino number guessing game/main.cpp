/*
The guessing project in C++ is a game designed to test the player’s luck and knowledge.
The player needs to guess a random number generated by the computer. If the player guesses right, they will win a certain amount of money.
The winning prize depends on the difficulty of the game. The program implements classes, functions, and user-defined data types.
It also uses other features such as loops and conditionals to create a logical structure. Furthermore, it makes use of the standard template library to implement basic operations and other data structures.

To do:
	Implement a score board.
