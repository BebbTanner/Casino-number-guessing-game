/*
The guessing project in C++ is a game designed to test the player’s luck and knowledge.
The player needs to guess a random number generated by the computer. If the player guesses right, they will win a certain amount of money.
The winning prize depends on the difficulty of the game. The program implements classes, functions, and user-defined data types.
It also uses other features such as loops and conditionals to create a logical structure. Furthermore, it makes use of the standard template library to implement basic operations and other data structures.

Player information X
	Create a player class X
	Bank amount X
	Name X

Check the player's bank amount before each turn?
	if the bank amount is <= $20
		Generate an easy number
		reward $5
	if the bank amount is > $20 or <= $100
		Generate a medium number
		reward = $10
	if the bank amount is > $100
		Generate a hard number
		reward $20

Give a prompt that lets the player know that they are advancing to the next difficulty.

Ask the user if they would like to play again.

Add a score board?
