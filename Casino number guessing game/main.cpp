/*
The guessing project in C++ is a game designed to test the player’s luck and knowledge.
The player needs to guess a random number generated by the computer. If the player guesses right, they will win a certain amount of money.
The winning prize depends on the difficulty of the game. The program implements classes, functions, and user-defined data types.
It also uses other features such as loops and conditionals to create a logical structure. Furthermore, it makes use of the standard template library to implement basic operations and other data structures.

It will not break out of the loop with all three of the functions.
